## 2021 Shopify Internship Challenge

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Built for the 2021 Shopify UX/Web Developer Internship Challenge.</h3>

## Features

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Built using React, Axios, Storybook CSS, and HTML</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Utilizes The <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDB</a> Open Movie Database API to search for movie titles.</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Live Search Bar Feature - Movie search results update on the page as characters are typed.</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Fully Responsive for optimal viewing on large and small devices.</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">Subtle animations on a number of page load and click events.</h3>

  ## Design and Development

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">My goal with this project was to create both a modern and simple UI that reflects the elegance and prestige or a movie award event like the Academy Awards. I wanted it to grab the attention of the user while remaining highly accessible.</h3>

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">The colors, fonts, text/border shadow, and animations all add to the award nomination experience.</h3>

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">I wanted the app to be highly functional and fully responsive and placed a large focus on making that happen. The applications makes sure that users can not add more than 5 movie nominations, and also checks all search items agains the nominee list to disable buttons if the title and the year are a match.</h3>

  ## Some Future Goals and Improvements

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">There are a lot more features that I would like to eventually add to the project. Here are a few of them.</h3>

- <h3 style="color: lightblue">1. Submit Button and Email Form to send users their nominee lists and potentially store in a server side DB.</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">2. A popup on page load which explains the awards, nomination process and how the site works.</h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">3. Show Movie Posters and additional information than the title and year. The API offers alot of info and it would be nice to utilize it. This would mean creating a slightly different layout to handle the larger images and text content. </h3>
- <h3 style="color: lightblue">4. Show more than 5 search items at a time. Again, this means a layout change to handle the larger amount of content. </h3>
